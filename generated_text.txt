Global warming is the gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans. It is caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and farming. As the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere rises, it causes climate change, which can have a variety of impacts on the environment and human health. These impacts include more frequent and intense droughts and floods, rising sea levels, and an increase in extreme weather events such as hurricanes and heat waves. To help reduce global warming, individuals and governments can reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases by using renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, and protecting forests.
